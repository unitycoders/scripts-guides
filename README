# UCKB 2.0 - Knowledge base for FOSS hackers
Idea by Joseph Walton-Rivers <joseph@webpigeon.me.uk>

## Structure
* Articles should be written in markdown, diagrams and the like are fine providing you either created them yourself or they are by-cc-sa.
* DOT, SVG, and ascii UML diagrams get extra kudos ;P.
* Filenames should contain [a-z0-9_-] only and end in .md (or whatever is relevent for other formats).
* Push changes to the git repo so everyone can get copies of the articles.

## Contributors
If you add or modify an article, add your name to the AUTHORS file. You're awesome for contributing and everyone should know that ;).
