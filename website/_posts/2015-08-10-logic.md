There is an algebra of logic, called boolean algebra. It was invented by
George Boole, an Irish mathematician.

## Operations
* primatives: NOT, OR, AND
* extras: XOR, implies, equals
* 16 possible truth tables for 2 operands (2^4)

## Truth Tables
A way of represting logical functions.

## properties
### commutative
order of operators indipendent

### linareraly seperable
Can be seperated by a single line if points plotted as a graph. 14 of 16 2 arg are. XOR is not.

### 2 Argument functions
| A | B | AND | OR | XOR | Implies | equilivence |
|---|---|--------| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **T** | **F** | F | T | T | F | F
| **T** | **T** | T | T | F | T | T
| **F** | **F** | F | T | T | T | T
| **F** | **T** | F | F | T | T | T

### derive
* x AND y = NOT ( NOT x OR NOT y)
* x OR y = NOT ( NOT x AND NOT y)
* x IMPL y = NOT X OR Y
* x XOR y = (x OR y) AND NOT (x AND y)
* x == y = NOT (x XOR y)
